your bombs be duds
and your keys be spicy

you're bad
at video games

(lying)

you wouldn't
survive
the simpsons

in your house

at puzzles

your ears are dirty

geek!

loser!

i bet you're
in the chess club

no shirts
no shoes
no service

i'm not sorry

i love you
...just kidding

a meteorite
will hit you

you should turn
to a
life of crime

spankety
spankety
spankety

there are
moths in your
pantry

your controller
is filled with
spiders

you're cringe

so false
worstie

your favorite ship
is immoral

your comfort
character
hates you

i deleted
your favorite save

your headcanon
is wrong

there is no god

there is no afterlife

a loving god
wouldn't have
abandoned you

everyone hates you

i hate you

your dog hates you

your cat hates you

your friends hate you

no escape

no future

you are wrong

your life sucks

you can't do it
give up already

you will die
behind a 7-11

you will die alone
and poorly dressed

fuck you

think about the time
you have wasted

it's not the
system's fault

you can't take care
of pets or kids

you can't take care
of plants

go to sleep
...forever

you looked better
with longer hair

you looked better
with shorter hair

you're ugly

your nose
looks weird

your nostrils
are weird

your eyes
look weird

your hands
look weird

your feet
look weird

your wrists
look weird

your knuckles
look weird

your neck
looks weird

your proportions
are off

your face
is asymmetrical

you have a face
only a mother
could love

not even
a mother could
love your face

you have
such an
ugly smile

everyone is
noticing
your flaws

you reek

you look older
than you are

you're so short
it's pathetic

you said *that*
and you were sober?
ouch!

i know what you did

i know what you are

you are going to
age and wither

today is not your day
and tomorrow isn't
gonna be, either

you're running
low on meds

you make an elephant
look thin

you make a stick insect
look fat

you're too fat
and also too thin

they know

i would say
it's over but
you never started

never once
did you try

why even bother

your name
doesn't suit you

you're supposed
to be
somewhere else

people are dying
and you're playing
video games?

you're done for

it's too late

your life has
no meaning

you hit your peak
years ago

you will be
forgotten

they never really
were on your side

we made up
a slur just to
insult you

you have a
mediocre ass

idiot

you'll be wrong
you're always wrong

stop saying sorry

stop apologizing
loser

you should be sorry

you better apologize

it's all gonna
crash and burn

your "bugs" will
never get fixed

you look like
a mistake

the good times
won't last

this will never end

everyone is
staring at you

they're all
judging you

after you die
it's just nothing
forever

stop blaming society

get mad at your lover

stop trying to cope

you'll never get
those years back

your parents
never loved you

you deserve to be
in pain

there's a reason
you don't have friends

it was all your fault

ask your best friend
where your partner is

that's not you
in the mirror

you're not
who you think
you are

are you really
yourself?

you're supposed
to be
someone else

you have zero
redeeming qualities

you have changed
and not in a good way

your surgery
will go wrong

take more drugs

you deserve
to get bullied

a few seconds
closer to death

you're not worth it

you were a mistake

don't have children

don't be yourself
it's embarrassing

you're never
gonna make it

how many more
years of this
